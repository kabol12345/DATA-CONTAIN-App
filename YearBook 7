Choosing a Color Palette
We mentioned above that focusing on readability is the first step to choosing font colors.

That applies here, too.

When choosing colors, you’ll want to focus on picking what causes the least amount of strain on readers’ eyes. Then, determine what aligns best with your theme, design, or creative expression.

Don’t worry; this is less restrictive than it sounds. Sometimes, it’s just a matter of taking your preferred colors and ratcheting them down a notch or two. (If you want a good explainer on how to do this, check out this post on color contrast.)

Of course, picking colors is the fun part.
