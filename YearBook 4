Number of Fonts
The single biggest temptation when designing a yearbook is adding personal elements of creativity.

And the easiest place to start? Fonts.

There are hundreds of ‘em, and everyone has a preference. Here’s the thing, though. Constantly changing them impacts your readers’ ability to comprehend what’s happening. (Don’t believe us? Science says so.) To avoid that situation—and to make your book look better— limit your fonts. Two is plenty; three is the absolute max.

Your fonts should complement each other. Ideally, you’ll have one serif font and one sans serif font. If you include a third font, you’ll probably end up with a script or something fancy.
