When you pick them, define their use:

Reserve your primary font for page elements, like headlines, subheads, and page numbers.
Utilize your secondary font for copy elements like body text, captions, and pull quotes.
If you’re using a third font, use it sparingly and only for specific elements (e.g., a headline and subhead combination or when dedicating full pages to section dividers).
You might be thinking, Two? Three? But that’s nothing! If so, take a deep breath.

We’ve already established that you’ll have two (maybe even three) fonts on each page. Add to that the variety of sizes you’ll need and color choices, and you’ll end up with way more variety than you thought for any given page.
