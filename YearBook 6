Sizes
Speaking of font sizes…

We mentioned above how each font should have a specific set of uses. 
To bring some order to your pages, you’ll want to assign each of those uses a font size. It sounds basic, but you can’t have a page number on one page being more prominent than a page number on another.

That’d just be weird.

Colors
When picking font colors for your style guide, the focus shouldn’t be on theme, design, or creative expression. It should be on readability.

That’s right: Start with making sure it’s easy to read the words on the page, then worry about the other aspects of color.

We’ll cover how you pick colors in the “choosing colors” section in a moment, but keep in mind that you want to keep your options limited. (Much like your font choices.) Again, focus on matching your colors to your fonts’ uses so your readers can recognize patterns and hierarchy.
