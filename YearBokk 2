Whatâ€™s a Yearbook Style Guide, Anyway?
A yearbook style guide provides guidelines on how your yearbook should be presented and covers two major areas: design and writing.

Used correctly, it lets you establish and enforce a consistent style throughout your yearbook and is a proactive way to coach your team and volunteers through the layout and design process.

But a yearbook style guide also works in another way. It lets you develop a vision for your book early on. And that alone has a considerable advantage.

Armed with a style guide that outlines, for example, what fonts and colors they need to use, your team is free to express creativity on what moves a book forward, like developing coverage ideas, getting great photos and quotes, and designing great layouts.

Think about it: If everyone is fretting over font choices and color palettes, they will have less time to do the stuff that makes an impact. Eliminate that distraction for them.
