A yearbook style guide can help you retain consistency throughout your book.

Not all by itself, mind you: You still need to use it. And create it.

In our experience, it’s the second half of that two-step process where people get hung up. After all, a yearbook’s a big deal. A lot is going on inside one: Headlines, captions, stories, photos, layouts, mods, clip art, and so on. And each element requires its own design choice.

Add up all those elements and all those choices, and you’ll see that creating a yearbook style guide can be a lot of work. That’s where this post comes in.

This post will cover what you should include in a yearbook style guide, why you should have one, and how to create and distribute it. We’ll even give you access to a free, ready-made yearbook style guide template you can use to jumpstart your own. Read on.
